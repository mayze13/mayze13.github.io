 <p style="font-size: 18px;"> I'm an aspiring <span style="color: #4169E1"><b>data scientist</b></span>, with a knack for AI as well as forward-facing positions such as <span style="color: #4169E1;"><b>consultancy</b></span> and <span style="color: #4169E1;"><b>teaching.</b></span> 
 Currently <span style="color: #2AAA8A;"><b>looking for work</b></span> anywhere in Europe, I am open to a variety of positions, from pure Python development to digital transformation consulting.<br><br></p>

 <p><em>The following paragraphs are my life story, essentially, detailing how I meandered my way to where I am now.</em><br><br></p>

  <div style="max-width: 450px;">
  <p><br>My childhood was a lively journey back and forth between France and Scotland, which entailed a bilingual upbringing.<br><br>
  Our family conversations at the dinner table were (and still are) a symphony of Franglish, peppered with a Scottish accent. It's quite unique.<br><br>
  I was always a bit nerdy (in a good way), enjoyed geeking out on atlases as a kid, and got interested in geography and mathematics from a young age.<br><br></p>

  <div style="max-width: 450px;">
  <p><br>Since I was quite good at school, I took up geography at university, where I studied its <span style="color: #4169E1">human aspects</span> such as cities, demographics, and politics.<br><br>
  The physical realm of rock formations and plate tectonics didn't capture my interest as much.<br><br>
  I had the opportunity to study abroad in Canada, where I delved way deeper into the human aspect through electives.<br><br>
  At the same time, my curiosity was increasingly drawn towards the <span style="color: #4169E1">biological underpinnings of human behaviour</span>, rather than their macro, societal dynamics. <br> Reading <span style="color: #4169E1"><b></b>Robert Sapolsky<b></b></span>, among others, was truly pivotal.<br><br></p>

  <div style="max-width: 450px;">
  <p><br>After graduating with my Bachelor's degree, I enacted my rite of passage into manhood by going to study <span style="color: #4169E1">wild monkeys</span> in the tropical rainforest of Malaysia. <br><br>
  I won't say too much about this here, but if you ask me about this, beware: this is my number 1 favourite topic of conversation.<br><br></p>

  <div style="max-width: 450px;">
  <p><br>Although ethology and primate behaviour still fascinate me today, my interest was always more towards human behaviour. <br><br>
  Therefore, I set sail to Amsterdam where I enrolled in the Masters of Brain and Cognitive Science.<br><br>
  I had the opportunity to work with brilliant scientists in Berlin, and took a particular liking to the topic of <span style="color: #4169E1">Environmental Neuroscience</span>. <br><br>
  No, no - this isn't understanding the effects of greenwashing on the brain, or the neural reward system of correctly sorting your waste.  Rather, it's about how our psychology and cognition are affected by the world around us: our cities, our landscapes, our offices, our homes.<br><br>
  It's an elegant combination of geography and neuroscience, in my view.<br><br></p>

  <div style="max-width: 450px;">
  <p><br>After obtaining my Master's degree, I embarked on the Data Science Bootcamp at <span style="color: #4169E1">Le Wagon</span>, seeing it as an extra, hands-on skill set, complementing the theoretical knowledge I had acquired.<br><br>
  I am now based in France, where I divide my time between Bordeaux and La Rochelle. I enjoy escaping to Lisbon as often as I can.<br><br>
  I've worked on a couple of Data Science and AI projects already, and I am eager to delve deeper and build a career in this blossoming field.<br><br></p>
