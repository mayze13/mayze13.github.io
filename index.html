 <p style="font-size: 18px;"> I'm an aspiring <span style="color: #0085A1"><b>data scientist</b></span>, with a knack for AI as well as forward-facing positions such as <span style="color: #0085A1;"><b>consultancy</b></span> and <span style="color: #0085A1;"><b>teaching.</b></span> 
 Currently <span style="color: #2AAA8A;"><b>looking for work</b></span> anywhere in Europe, I am open to a variety of positions, from pure Python development to digital transformation consulting.<br><br></p>

   <p><br>My childhood was a lively journey back and forth between France and Scotland, which entailed a bilingual upbringing.<br><br>
   Our family conversations at the dinner table were (and still are) a symphony of Franglish, peppered with a Scottish accent. It's quite unique.<br><br>
   I was always a bit nerdy (in a good way), enjoyed geeking out on atlases as a kid, and got interested in geography and mathematics from a young age.<br><br></p>

  <p>I was always a bit nerdy (in a good way), enjoyed geeking out on atlases as a kid, and got interested in geography and mathematics from a young age.<br><br>
  Since I was quite good at school, I took up geography at university, where I studied its <span style="color: #0085A1">human aspects</span> such as cities, demographics, and politics.<br><br>
  The physical realm of rock formations and plate tectonics didn't capture my interest as much.</p><br><br>

   <p>I had the opportunity to study abroad in Canada, where I delved way deeper into the human aspect through electives.<br><br>
   At the same time, my curiosity was increasingly drawn towards the <span style="color: #0085A1">biological</span> underpinnings of human behaviour, rather than their macro, societal dynamics. </p> <br><br>

  <p> During the long and cold winter in Montreal, I read extensively. Diving into the ideas of Yuval Harari, Jared Diamond, and <span style="color: #4169E1"><b></b>Robert Sapolsky<b></b></span>, among others, was truly pivotal.<br><br></p>

   <p><br>After graduating with my Bachelor's degree, I enacted my rite of passage into manhood by going to study <span style="color: #0085A1">wild monkeys</span> in the tropical rainforest of Malaysia. <br><br>
   I won't say too much about this here, but if you ask me about this, <b>beware</b>: this is my number 1 favourite topic of conversation.<br><br></p>

   <p><span style="color: #0085A1">Environmental Neuroscience</span>No, no - this isn't understanding the effects of greenwashing on the brain, or the neural reward system of correctly sorting your waste.  Rather, it's about how our psychology and cognition are affected by the world around us: our cities, our landscapes, our offices, our homes.<br><br>
   It's an elegant combination of geography and neuroscience, in my view.<br><br></p>
